      <h2 id="tribute-heading-1">ABOUT</h2>
      <p class="about">
        Pichai Sundararajan (born June 10, 1972), better known as Sundar Pichai,
        is an Indian-born American business executive.He is the chief executive
        officer (CEO) of Alphabet Inc. and its subsidiary Google.<br />

        Born in Madras, India, Pichai earned his degree from IIT Kharagpur in
        metallurgical engineering. Moving to the United States, he attained an
        M.S. from Stanford University in materials science and engineering and
        further attained an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of
        Pennsylvania, where he was named a Siebel Scholar and a Palmer Scholar,
        respectively.<br />

        Pichai began his career as a materials engineer. Following a short stint
        at the management consulting firm McKinsey & Co., Pichai joined Google
        in 2004, where he led the product management and innovation efforts for
        a suite of Google's client software products, including Google Chrome
        and Chrome OS, as well as being largely responsible for Google Drive. In
        addition, he went on to oversee the development of other applications
        such as Gmail and Google Maps. In 2010, Pichai also announced the
        open-sourcing of the new video codec VP8 by Google and introduced the
        new video format, WebM. The Chromebook was released in 2012. In 2013,
        Pichai added Android to the list of Google products that he oversaw<br />

        Pichai was selected to become the next CEO of Google on August 10, 2015,
        after previously being appointed Product Chief by CEO Larry Page. On
        October 24, 2015, he stepped into the new position at the completion of
        the formation of Alphabet Inc., the new holding company for the Google
        company family. He was appointed to the Alphabet Board of Directors in
        2017.<br />

        Pichai was included in Time's annual list of the 100 most influential
        people in 2016 and 2020. On December 11, 2018, Sundar Pichai was
        questioned by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee on a range of
        Google-related issues such as possible political bias on Google's
        platforms, the company's alleged plans for a "censored search app" in
        China, and its privacy practices. In response, Pichai informed the
        committee that Google employees cannot influence search results. He also
        stated that Google users can opt out of having their data collected and
        that "there are no current plans for a censored search engine" in
        China.<br />
        Wired's Issie Lapowsky characterized Pichai's appearance before the
        committee as a "major missed opportunity," since, as she wrote, its
        members "staked out opposite sides of a partisan battle". In October
        2020, the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and
        Transportation unanimously voted in favor of, and on a bipartisan basis,
        to subpoena Pichai, along with the CEOs of Facebook and Twitter, to
        testify before the committee in response to lawmakers' concerns over the
        technology industry's exemption from Section 230 of the Communications
        Decency Act of 1934.

      <h2 id="tribute-heading-2">CAREER</h2>
      <p class="career">
        Pichai worked in engineering and product management at Applied Materials
        and in management consulting at McKinsey & Company.Pichai joined Google
        in 2004, where he led the product management and innovation efforts for
        a suite of Google's client software products, including Google Chrome
        and Chrome OS, as well as being largely responsible for Google Drive. He
        went on to oversee the development of other applications such as Gmail
        and Google Maps.On November 19, 2009, Pichai gave a demonstration of
        Chrome OS; the Chromebook was released for trial and testing in 2011,
        and released to the public in 2012. On May 20, 2010, he announced the
        open-sourcing of the new video codec VP8 by Google and introduced the
        new video format, WebM.<br />

        On March 13, 2013, Pichai added Android to the list of Google products
        that he oversaw. Android was formerly managed by Andy Rubin. He was a
        director of Jive Software from April 2011 to July 30, 2013. Pichai was
        selected to become the next CEO of Google on August 10, 2015 after
        previously being appointed Product Chief by CEO, Larry Page. On October
        24, 2015 he stepped into the new position at the completion of the
        formation of Alphabet Inc., the new holding company for the Google
        company family.<br />

        Pichai had been suggested as a contender for Microsoft's CEO in 2014, a
        position that was eventually given to Satya Nadella.<br />

        In August 2017, Pichai drew publicity for firing a Google employee who
        wrote a ten-page manifesto criticizing the company's diversity policies
        and arguing that "distribution of preferences and abilities of men and
        women differ in part due to biological causes and ... these differences
        may explain why we don't see equal representation of women in tech and
        leadership". While noting that the manifesto raised a number of issues
        that are open to debate, Pichai said in a memo to Google employees that
        "to suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less
        biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK".<br />

        In December 2017, Pichai was a speaker at the World Internet Conference
        in China, where he stated that "a lot of work Google does is to help
        Chinese companies. There are many small and medium-sized businesses in
        China who take advantage of Google to get their products to many other
        countries outside of China."<a
